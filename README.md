# VS Code Azure Resource Manager Snipets

This extension adds snippets to Visual Studio Code for creating Azure DevOps pipeline YAML configuration.

Add them to your Preferences > User Snippets > YAML,

These snippets are taken from the Pipeline YAML [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=vsts&tabs=example#checkout).
