# VS Code Azure DevOps Pipeline YAML Snippets

This extension adds snippets to Visual Studio Code for creating Azure DevOps pipeline YAML configuration.

Add them to your Preferences > User Snippets > YAML,

I'm working on an installer that drops them in as an extension


These snippets are taken from the Pipeline YAML [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=vsts&tabs=example#checkout). I've taken the ones I use the most, but ping for more if interested.
